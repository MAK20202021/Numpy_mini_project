# Numpy_mini_project
Numpy is Numerical Python. It is an extensive math library. It improves the speed of the process. It creates multidimentional array data structures that can represent vectors and matrices. In machine learning we need to do feature scaling which is called as mean mormalizing. In this exercise, we took random values between 0 and 10,000 and we made the data between 0 and 1 or sometimes very small range around between -3 and 3 by normalizing. Therefore, the average will be near zero. In this project, there is a good example how to choose data for machine learning algorithm. 60% sets have been chosen as training set, 20% sets have been chosen as cross validation sets and 20% sets have been chosen as test sets. It has been made sure that any of the sets values will not overlap each other.
